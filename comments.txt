# We tie it in to the vanilla tech tree, which looks like this:
# tech_combat_computers_1:0 "Specialized Combat Computers"
# tech_combat_computers_2:0 "Extended Combat Algorithms"
# tech_combat_computers_3:0 "Sentient Combat Simulations"

# I designed ships specifically for the AI in global ship designs.
# If we don't set should_ai_use on these computers, the auto build will
# use them.
# So what I do is created set ship templates for them to use, and every
# 30 days I randomly allow AI empires to build those ships.

# So, about the movement speed.
# Corvette gets 20% speed from computers + 60% from thrusters
# These bonuses seem to be additive, so * 1.8
# Corvette base is 1.75
# So normal Corvette combat speed at max level should be 3.15, rounded down
# That's the speed we need to match.

# THE SPEED CALCULATIONS BELOW ARE WRONG
# It seems the game actually treats battleships differently than
# cruisers and destroyers, and I have not figured it out. I didn't need to,
# because I hit the sweet spot for the modifier almost immediately :-)
#
# BATTLESHIP
# Base = 0.75
# Assume Afterburner L-slot: 60%
# Assume Thrusters 4: 60%
# Adjusted base = 0.75*2.2=1.65
# We are missing 1.45, but since BS is always at the back of formation, we need
# to be 10% faster than Corvettes. 3.1*1.1=3.41.
# So we are missing 3.41-1.64 = 1.77
#	Adjusted Base		*		X		= 		GOAL!
# 		1.65			*		2.06	=		3.34

# CRUISER AND DESTROYER
# Base = 1.25
# Our bonus is applied first
# Assume afterburner M-slot: 30%
# Assume thrusters: 60%
# Adjusted base = 1.25*1.9=2.375
# We are missing 0.725 (3.1-2.375)
#	Adjusted Base		*		X		=		GOAL!
#		2.375			*		0.98	=		3.111

# These go in modifier
# ship_hitpoints_mult = 0.05
# ship_shield_regen_add = 15.0 # Regeneration per day
# ship_auto_repair_add = 0.02 # Regenerates 2% ship-health per month
