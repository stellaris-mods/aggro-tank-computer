# So, here's the deal:
# We need to force the AI to auto-update the global ship design, because
# I can't be arsed to write in 100 different designs for all the god damn
# components.
# So we set the folk_tanks_ai_use country flag, then we make sure they have a
# "Tank Destroyer" ship design with the tank computer in it, and then we give
# this tech, which forces them to update designs.
